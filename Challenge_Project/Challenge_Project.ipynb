It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally, there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to **goiter**. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or cretinism.\n","\n","Worldwide, too little **iodine** in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In countries with enough iodine in the diet, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition **Hashimoto's thyroiditis**. Less common causes include previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, and previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with **blood tests** measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.\n","\n","About one billion people around the world are estimated to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, hypothyroidism occurs in nearly **5% of Americans over the age of 12**.\n","\n","And that is why we iodize salt.\n","\n","![thyroid-gland.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MedlyticsUniversal/Data/main/Images/thyroid-gland.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"1bd5183d32e74723a96270400ae02bbb","colab_type":"text","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"OFF1-BLiSLZ8"},"source":["Doctors all around the world need our help to predict whether a patient has hypothyroidism. We have already **overspent** our budget to collect such comprehensive data on about 30 attributes for 2,800 patients—a good starting number, but a larger sample would certainly be preferred. Moving forward, however, we simply cannot afford to spend so much money on data collection. Therefore, we also need to determine **which attributes are the most meaningful** to the predictive models, and cut out the rest that don't contribute much.\n","\n","The boss wants to see a **balanced** model that can predict with a **high sensitivity** and **high specificity** while using a ***low amount of features***. Collecting complete data such as this is very rare, very time-consuming, and often very expensive. By minimizing the number of features, we can optimize future data collection and decide what needs to be collected and what doesn't."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"6e199f4b8a664317a7d79bb678beefd1","colab_type":"text","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"HsZB_SGvp4mP"},"source":["## Loading the data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"47e2407dbed748478ebeb6b1490b8a45","colab_type":"text","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"DWrUz9OQ0uAU"},"source":["Let's read the data into a Pandas DataFrame and look at the first 20 records."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cell_id":"fd055bdbe168413b8140572a72864c26","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}},"colab_type":"code","deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_millis":117,"execution_start":1696549930454,"id":"s9AtXQPkzC8j","source_hash":null},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MedlyticsUniversal/Data/main/Week1/allhypo.train.csv'\n","dataset = pd.read_csv(url) # this loads the dataset into a dataframe called `dataset`\n","\n","### YOUR CODE HERE\n","### Look up the head() function.

In doing so, we hope you see the importance of **clinical considerations** and treat your models from a more **human perspective**, rather than be detached from it.\n","- Similar to the confusion matrix, we want you to keep in mind the other aspects of healthcare analytics—in this case, **economic feasibility**. In essence, we want you to minimize the amount of time and money spent on data collection by reducing the number of features collected. Each record certainly required a lot of time and money from several individuals and businesses to reliably create, and we hope you gain a better understanding of conducting a useful cost-benefit analysis with this scoring method.
